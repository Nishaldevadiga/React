Transitive dependency: we have dependency on parcel but parcel might be dependent on other lib, so when we use parcel dependency it uses other packages and thats why node modules have so many files for a single dependency.

npx-> means executing a package we use npx


parcel:
1. dev build
2. local server
3. HMR(Hot Module Replacement)
4. File Watching Algorithm(C++)
5. Caching- Faster Builds
6. Image Optimization
7. Minification of files
8. Bundling
9. Compressing the files
10.Error


const data=1000;


//Functional Component- NEW
//javascript function returns a react element
//Component inside another component is called component composition
const Heading=()=>
  {
  return (
    <div id="container">
      <h2>{data}</h2>
      <Tile/>
  <h1>Welcome to React</h1>
  </div>
  );

  }

  ---> {}--> javascript isnt run it is sanitized by using {} to prevent cross site scripting attacks.
